The main node server script that holds all of the functions will be coming soon, along with the guide.

Note that the other files will always be updated when the server file is updated. If one functionality is added....it needs to be added in the voice commands (intent/utterances) within Alexa and also with AWS Lambda to know how to talk to your computer.
